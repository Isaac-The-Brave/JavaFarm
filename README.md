# JavaFarm

## An Ongoing project
A small farm built in Java, purely to learn and document my own Object Oriented Programming progress and general ideas I had while I was building it.

### Made to continue development, currently learning 3D rendering to turn these objects into interactive 3D models with real time point-collection
Currently learning how to render the most important axis, depth! Keep up with the changes of this project.
